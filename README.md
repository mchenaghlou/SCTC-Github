SCTC: An incremental subspace clustering algorithm for high-dimensional time-series data

The experiments of the research paper titled "SCTC: An incremental subspace clustering algorithm for high-dimensional time-series data" is presented. This paper proposes an incremental subspace algorithm for infinite time-series data. It is capable of identifying two cases where the current state-of-the-art algorithm are unable to detect. First, multi-cluster subspaces, and second, overlapping clusters in dependent subspace.

The results of the proposed algorithm (SCTC) can be obtained by running the script "experiments_SCTC". The results of the LRR algorithm can be obtained by running the script "experiments_LRR". The results of the LSR algorithm can be obtained by running the script "experiments_LSR". The results of the OSC algorithm can be obtained by running the script "experiments_OSC". The results of the TSC algorithm can be obtained by running the script "experiments_TSC". The results of the k-flat algorithm can be obtained by running the script "experiments_KFlat". The results of the k-subspaces algorithm can be obtained by running the script "experiments_KSubspaces".
